It’s not just about mastering subjects, but about changing lives. <br><br> For the first time, projects for students are taking shape with the input of fabbers and teachers. <br><br> What’s more, technology will amplify this community’s know-how to STEM teachers who are eager to learn and incorporate instruction with digital fabrication projects for their students, from Kindergarten to 12th grade. <br><br> Collaborative and crowd-sourced information so teachers can tap into digital fabrication as an instructional tool. A reservoir of digital fabrication lessons aligned to standards and available for teachers to try out and use, to influence others and encourage the adoption of ideas, activities and teaching tips."},
